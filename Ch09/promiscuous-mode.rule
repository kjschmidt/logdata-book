# When a network interface is placed into promiscuous mode, all packets are sent to the kernel for processing, 
# including packets not destined for the MAC address of the network interface card. The one main reason that 
# this is a bad thing is because users on the system with a promiscuous mode network interface can now use a 
# tool like a sniffer to view any and all network packets. Let’s look at how to detect an interface going into promiscuous mode on Linux:
type=Single
ptype=RegExp
pattern=^.*(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+).* (.*?) entered promiscuous mode$
desc=$0
action= write – Interface $2 on $1 entered promiscuous mode
